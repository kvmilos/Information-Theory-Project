# Entropy Analysis of Recipe Instructions Across Cuisines and Complexity Levels

**Project Goal**  
Apply information-theoretic measures (unigram/bigram entropy, multi-gram entropy, mutual information, and Zipfâ€™s law) to a large recipe dataset to reveal how textual diversity and complexity vary with cuisine type, recipe length, preparation time, and ingredient count.

**Dataset**  
- RAW_recipes.csv from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions).  
  Contains ~230k+ recipes with fields like steps, tags, minutes, n_ingredients, etc.

**Files**  
- [Jupyter Notebook](./project.ipynb)  
- [Markdown Version of Notebook](./project.md)  
- [Project Report](./report.pdf)
